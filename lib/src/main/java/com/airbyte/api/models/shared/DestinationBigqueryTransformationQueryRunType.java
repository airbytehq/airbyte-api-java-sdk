 * DestinationBigqueryTransformationQueryRunType - Interactive run type means that the query is executed as soon as possible, and these queries count towards concurrent rate limit and daily limit. Read more about interactive run type &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Batch queries are queued and started as soon as idle resources are available in the BigQuery shared resource pool, which usually occurs within a few minutes. Batch queries donâ€™t count towards your concurrent rate limit. Read more about batch queries &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#batch"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The default "interactive" value is used if not set explicitly.
